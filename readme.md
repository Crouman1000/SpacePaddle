## SpacePaddle

![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-yellow)

This game is a modern take on the classic Pong, developed by me using **Python** and **Pygame** library. The goal of this project was to create a simple game to demonstrate my understanding of Python, object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and adherence to current Python best practices, including PEP8 coding standards.

SpacePaddle allows you to play against a very strong "AI", although it is beatable. You can also play with someone else in your vicinity using the multiplayer mode and a common keyboard.

## Beta Notice

Spacepaddle is considered beta for now because it was not broadly tested yet, and could use some more features, like sprites, LAN or even WAN multiplayer, Bluetooth controller support, easier "AI", and some enhanced gameplay features. I tested thoroughly and have not found bugs myself, but please do not hesitate to submit any bug you find to "cr0j.gh@outlook.com".
